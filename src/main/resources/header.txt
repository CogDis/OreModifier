Note #1: CC licenses anticipate that a licensor may want to waive compliance with a specific condition, such as attribution.
Note #2: A work is in the public domain when it is free for use by anyone for any purpose without restriction under copyright.
Note #3: All jurisdictions allow some limited uses of copyrighted material without permission. CC licenses do not affect the
      rights of users under those copyright limitations and exceptions, such as fair use and fair dealing where applicable.
Note #4: In addition to the right of licensors to request removal of their name from the work when used in a derivative or
      collective they don't like, copyright laws in most jurisdictions around the world (with the notable exception of the US
      except in very limited circumstances) grant creators "moral rights" which may provide some redress if a derivative work
      represents a "derogatory treatment" of the licensor's work.
Note #5: Publicity rights allow individuals to control how their voice, image or likeness is used for commercial purposes in
      public. If a CC-licensed work includes the voice or image of anyone other than the licensor, a user of the work may need
      to get permission from those individuals before using the work for commercial purposes.
